## Getting Started

- Checkout the source code

    git clone git@github.com:openboxes/openboxes-mobile.git
    ```
- Download app dependencies
    ```
    cd openboxes-mobile
    yarn install
    ```
- At this point the necessary dependencies would have been downloaded and further development can happen.
  
## Environment setup
Follow the instructions given [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#development-os) to set up your 
environment depending on the OS running on your machine(Windows, MacOS, Linux), and the mobile device you want to 
run the app on(Android, iOS).

## Build and run the app
### On Android
```
yarn android
```

Depending on whether an Android device is already connected to the machine, it will try running the app on that device,
or it will try launching an emulator.

### On iOS
```
